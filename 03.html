  I learnt about strings (the best part so far), ways to create strings using single quote and double quote
  I learnt about Concatenation , combining two or more strings together.
  I learnt about "type of" , used to know if a particulat term is a boolean , number or  a string.
  <!---try it in your console-->
  I learnt about escape characters eg /' to create a single quote , /" to create a double quote and /n to create a newline character.
  I learnt about template strings , it allows us to insert a value directly into a string(This is called interpolation) , it also allows us to create multiple line strings.
  have you ever worked with button onclick attribute?
  <button onclick="alert('wowww , nice')";>Click me hooughs</button>

<script>
  console.log("Hello" + " World");//concatenation
  // okay so take note of this:
  console.log('$' + 2 + 4);
  //ans:24
  console.log('$' + (2+4));
  //ans:6
  //Brackets are very important when dealing with numbers in Js.
  //Lets have something about floats.
  console.log(20.95+7.99);
  //ans:28.939999999999998
  console.log((2095+799)/100);
  //ans:28.94
  //floats inaccuracies.
  //ESCAPE CHARACTERS
 ///wrong console.log('I'm learning Javascript');
          console.log("I\'m learning Javascript");//its a backward slash
          console.log("I'm learning JS");
 ///wrong console.log('I'm learning Javascript');
          console.log('I\"m learning Javascript');//its a backward slash
          console.log('I"m learning JS');
  console.log('some\ntext'); //it will display these two words in separate line , its like the br tag in html.
  //Lets Interpolatee ahahahahhaahha
  console.log(`Items in the cart are just ${ 10+70+4} in total and it costs $${700+500+40}`);
  console.log(`What i will like to eat:

  //challenge exercises solution
  console.log('Total cost: $' + (599+295)/100);
  console.log(`Total cost: $${(599+295/100)}`);
  alert(`Total cost: $8.94

  console.log(`Estimated tax (10%): $${Math.round(10/100 * 6786/100)}`);
