  I learnt more about Numbers and maths.
  Order of operations 
  eg 2*3/5 , this will start solving it from left to right.
  we have whole numbers eg 2,3,4 and decimal numbers eg 2.2 , 3.5 they are also knowns as floats or floating point numbers.
  there are some inacccuracies when using float. so it is always available to use whole numbers in JS eg if you want to input 4.99 , you do this: (499/100)
  you use math.round to round up or down a number
  you use math.floor to always round down a number
  you use math.ceil to round up a number

  <script>
   console.log(Math.round(2.2));
   console.log(Math.round(3.5));
